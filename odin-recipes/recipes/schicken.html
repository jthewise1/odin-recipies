<p>Step 1: Place chicken in a pot with seasonings and water
To make boiled chicken, carefully place the pieces of meat in a pot first. Then, toss in your desired seasonings to make sure that your shredded chicken wonâ€™t be bland. Once done, fill the pot with water just until the meat is covered by an inch of the liquid.

Step 2: Boil chicken until done
Now you can proceed to boil the chicken. Turn your stovetop on and once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer. The time it takes for how long to boil chicken may vary according to the size of the meat, but it generally takes up to 16 minutes. To check if the boiled or poached chicken is cooked, take the pieces out of the pot and measure their internal temperature with a meat thermometer. It should read 165 degrees F.
